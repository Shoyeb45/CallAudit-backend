    Handles the upload of a call recording and initiates its processing pipeline.

    This endpoint receives an audio file and associated metadata via a multipart
    form request. It saves the file temporarily, then delegates the processing
    workflow to the `CounsellorService`. The service handles database record
    creation, background audio upload to S3, AI analysis, and result storage.

    Args:
        request (Request): The incoming FastAPI Request object. Used to access
                           application state, specifically `request.app.state.s3_saver`.
        call_recording (UploadFile): The audio file uploaded by the client.
        call_start (str): ISO format string representing the call's start time.
        call_end (str): ISO format string representing the call's end time.
        duration (str): String representation of the call's duration in seconds.
        call_type (str): The type or category of the call.
        client_number (str): The phone number or identifier of the client.
        tags (str): Comma-separated tags associated with the call.
        counsellor_id (str): The unique identifier of the counsellor who handled the call.
        service (CounsellorService): An instance of CounsellorService, injected
                                   by FastAPI's dependency system.

    Returns:

        CallRecordingProcessingSchema: A Pydantic model representing the immediate
                                     response to the client. Indicates that the
                                     recording was received and initial processing
                                     (database record creation) was successful.
                                     The status is typically 'processing'.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: An HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity error is raised automatically
                       by FastAPI if required form fields or the file are missing.
                       An HTTP 500 Internal Server Error is raised if there's a failure
                       during file saving or initial processing within the service.
