Authentication and Authorization Module

This module provides authentication utilities for FastAPI applications, specifically
handling JWT token-based authentication for auditor and manager user roles.

The module implements a dependency injection pattern for user authentication,
extracting JWT tokens from HTTP cookies, validating them, and returning the
appropriate user objects based on their roles.

Key Features:
    - JWT token validation from HTTP cookies
    - Role-based user authentication (Auditor/Manager)
    - Database user verification
    - Comprehensive error handling and logging
    - Type hints for better code maintainability

Dependencies:
    - FastAPI: Web framework components
    - SQLAlchemy: Database ORM
    - python-jose: JWT token handling
    - Custom repositories for user data access

Example:
    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
    from auth import get_current_user
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    @app.get("/protected")
    async def protected_route(current_user = Depends(get_current_user)):
        return {"user": current_user.email, "role": current_user.role}
    ```

    """
    FastAPI dependency for authenticating and retrieving the current user.
    
    This function serves as a dependency injection for FastAPI routes that require
    user authentication. It extracts JWT tokens from HTTP cookies, validates them,
    and returns the corresponding user object from the database based on their role.
    
    The function supports two user types:
    - Auditor: Users with auditing privileges
    - Manager: Users with management privileges
    
    Authentication Flow:
    1. Extract JWT token from 'token' cookie
    2. Decode and validate the token using configured secret and algorithm
    3. Extract email and role from token payload
    4. Query database for user based on role
    5. Return user object if found, raise HTTPException otherwise
    
    Args:
        req (Request): FastAPI request object containing HTTP cookies and headers.
                      The 'token' cookie must contain a valid JWT token.
        db (Session, optional): SQLAlchemy database session for user queries.
                               Defaults to Depends(get_db) for dependency injection.
    
    Returns:
    
        Auditor | Manager: Returns either an Auditor or Manager object based on 
                          the role specified in the JWT token. The returned object
                          contains all user information from the database.
    
    Raises:
        HTTPException: Raised in the following scenarios:
            - 401 UNAUTHORIZED: Missing token, invalid token payload, or invalid user role
            - 404 NOT_FOUND: User not found in database despite valid token
            - 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR: Unexpected errors during authentication process
    
    Security Considerations:
        - Tokens are expected to be httpOnly cookies for XSS protection
        - JWT tokens must be signed with the configured secret key
        - Token algorithm must match the configured algorithm
        - Database verification ensures token hasn't been compromised
    
    Example:
        ```python
        @app.get("/dashboard")
        async def dashboard(current_user: Auditor | Manager = Depends(get_current_user)):
            return {
                "message": f"Welcome {current_user.email}",
                "role": current_user.role,
                "permissions": current_user.permissions
            }
        ```
    
    Note:
        This function should be used as a FastAPI dependency. Direct calls are not
        recommended as they bypass the dependency injection system.
